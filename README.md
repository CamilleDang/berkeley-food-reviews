# Hello dogs! 🐕 
## Welcome to a 99% honest (and very subjective!) ranking of Berkeley food places. ja bitte bb ⛅️ 

### Almare Gelato 🍨 
2170 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley, CA 94704

10🌟/10
I must start off this ranking with my all-time favorite ice cream / gelato place ever. Jaja. Almare *never* misses. Firstly, it is such a cool, cute shop with rotating gelato flavors (my personal favorite: strawberry + ube!). The fruit sorbet are incredibly fresh, and the gelato is so creamy and delicious. Not to mention, it is **so** worth the buckaroos 💴! They pack the cup, and allow you to mix and match flavors to your desire, even down to the ratios! The location is also Downtown and is very lovely. It's also right next to the hearty BART, so if you're feeling a bit snacky after a BART 🚊 ride, you will go here. Yes you will. 

### Bagel Street Cafe 🥯 
2148 Center St, Berkeley, CA 94704

8/10
The location is very rad and convenient, and is a great place to grab a quick breakfast before going to class. I went here two times in a row for breakfast. 🍳 Although this is an egg emoji, there was no egg in either of the bagels I ordered.
I enjoyed the lox bagel. It was definitely worth the money 💰. It was so much that I had to ask my father to finish it. The second bagel was simply an everything bagel with cream cheese. Yum! 
I did catch a fly on one of the bagels though... #notrad.

No picture was taken. Therefore, here is a picture of the store that I took from Google:
