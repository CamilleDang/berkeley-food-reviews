# Hello dogs! 🐕 
## Welcome to a 99% honest (and very subjective!) ranking of Berkeley food places. ja bitte bb ⛅️ 

### Almare Gelato 🍨 
2170 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley, CA 94704

10🌟/10
I must start off this ranking with my all-time favorite ice cream / gelato place ever. Jaja. Almare *never* misses. Firstly, it is such a cool, cute shop with rotating gelato flavors (my personal favorite: strawberry + ube!). The fruit sorbet are incredibly fresh, and the gelato is so creamy and delicious. Not to mention, it is **so** worth the buckaroos 💴! They pack the cup, and allow you to mix and match flavors to your desire, even down to the ratios! The location is also Downtown and is very lovely. It's also right next to the hearty BART, so if you're feeling a bit snacky after a BART 🚊 ride, you will go here. Yes you will.

### Bagel Street Cafe 🥯 
2148 Center St, Berkeley, CA 94704

8/10
The location is very rad and convenient, and is a great place to grab a quick breakfast before going to class. I went here two times in a row for breakfast. 🍳 Although this is an egg emoji, there was no egg in either of the bagels I ordered.
I enjoyed the lox bagel. It was definitely worth the money 💰. It was so much that I had to ask my father to finish it. The second bagel was simply an everything bagel with cream cheese. Yum! 
I did catch a fly on one of the bagels though... #notrad.

No picture was taken. Therefore, here is a picture of the store that I took from Google:

### Burma Superstar 💫 
4721 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94609

8/10
This was one of the top-rated restaurants in Oakland. Jaja. #tbh had a quite emotional experience 💧 here as this was my last day with my dad before going off on my own...but it was a great place! We got really lucky with the lack of wait, and the waiters were very kind. 👄 For example, we ordered one of their signature salads, and they tossed it for us and made lovely conversation. 👏 
The food was quite delicious, but not anything *crazy* good. Yes. But I very much enjoyed it!
I probably would go here again, but also, I might not. 
But again, it was quite enjoyable!
Ja. ❤️

### Crossroads 🚗 
2415 Bowditch St, Berkeley, CA 94720

7/10
I don't go here often. Sometimes, the environment is very loud 👂 and overwhelming. However, the food is not too bad, and has many choices. Ja. If I had to pay to go here, I would not step in the building. However, props to the chefs. 👩‍🍳 👨‍🍳 




### Cafe 3 🥕 
2400 Durant Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704

6/10
Listen. It's definitely a hit or miss... but also, I've been able to eat in Cafe 3 for free this entire summer. Therefore, I am choosing to focus on the positives.
Some of my favorites:
* grilled broccoli
* soyrizo + brown rice
* pineapple salmon
