# Hello dogs! 🐕 
## Welcome to a 99% honest (and very subjective!) ranking of Berkeley / NorCal food places. ja bitte bb ⛅️ 

### Almare Gelato 🍨 
2170 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley, CA 94704

10🌟/10

I must start off this ranking with my all-time favorite ice cream / gelato place ever. Jaja. Almare *never* misses. Firstly, it is such a cool, cute shop with rotating gelato flavors (my personal favorite: strawberry + ube!). The fruit sorbet are incredibly fresh, and the gelato is so creamy and delicious. Not to mention, it is **so** worth the buckaroos 💴! They pack the cup, and allow you to mix and match flavors to your desire, even down to the ratios! The location is also Downtown and is very lovely. It's also right next to the hearty BART, so if you're feeling a bit snacky after a BART 🚊 ride, you will go here. Yes you will.

### Bagel Street Cafe 🥯 
2148 Center St, Berkeley, CA 94704

8🌟/10

The location is very rad and convenient, and is a great place to grab a quick breakfast before going to class. I went here two times in a row for breakfast. 🍳 Although this is an egg emoji, there was no egg in either of the bagels I ordered.
I enjoyed the lox bagel. It was definitely worth the money 💰. It was so much that I had to ask my father to finish it. The second bagel was simply an everything bagel with cream cheese. Yum! 
I did catch a fly on one of the bagels though... #notrad.

No picture was taken. Therefore, here is a picture of the store that I took from Google:

### Taiwan Professional Tea ☕️ 
2383 Telegraph Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704

9🌟/10

Ja. So I, like many others, quite *enjoy* boba. So, I knew I *had* to find a good boba place. This was recommended. And it was not too bad #bros! I actually really enjoyed it! Father and I shared a milk and fruit tea and interchanged them whenever we pleased, and it was quite a good combination, especially in conjunction with the view of the Berkeley marina (which is where we drove to). I also went here later with Mother, and we both quite Enjoyed it. Ja bitte. I like it. It's a Yes. I guess. No. I know. ✔️  For some reason, I did not take a picture (of either times), but I will be including a pleasing picture from the interweb.

### Burma Superstar 💫 
4721 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, CA 94609

8🌟/10

This was one of the top-rated restaurants in Oakland. Jaja. #tbh had a quite emotional experience 💧 here as this was my last day with my dad before going off on my own...but it was a great place! We got really lucky with the lack of wait, and the waiters were very kind. 👄 For example, we ordered one of their signature salads, and they tossed it for us and made lovely conversation. 👏 
The food was quite delicious, but not anything *crazy* good. Yes. But I very much enjoyed it!
I probably would go here again, but also, I might not. 
But again, it was quite enjoyable!
Ja. ❤️

### Crossroads 🚗 
2415 Bowditch St, Berkeley, CA 94720

7🌟/10

I don't go here often. Sometimes, the environment is very loud 👂 and overwhelming. However, the food is not too bad, and has many choices. Ja. If I had to pay full-price to go here, I would not step foot in the building. However, props to the chefs. 👩‍🍳 👨‍🍳
