### Bagel Street Cafe
2148 Center St, Berkeley, CA 94704

8/10
The location is very rad and convenient, and is a great place to grab a quick breakfast before going to class. I went here two times in a row for breakfast. 🍳 Although this is an egg emoji, there was no egg in either of the bagels I ordered.
I enjoyed the lox bagel. It was definitely worth the money 💰. It was so much that I had to ask my father to finish it. The second bagel was simply an everything bagel with cream cheese. Yum! 
I did catch a fly on one of the bagels though... #notrad.

No picture was taken. Therefore, here is a picture of the store that I took from Google:
